# In Python, .pyc files are auto-generated compiled bytecode versions of .py
# files that are used to speed up execution by avoiding recompilation, and 
# Python runs them instead of the .py files if they are up-to-date.

# Using Python's built-in dis module, you can view the compiled bytecode of a 
# .py file by importing the module, loading the target function (either from the same file or another .py file),
# and passing it to dis.dis() to see how Python internally translates your code into low-level instructions for execution.
